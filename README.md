# Multi-Tenant Telegram Bot

This is a multi-tenant Telegram bot service built with **Aiogram**, **Aiohttp**, and **HashiCorp Vault**.  
It allows managing multiple tenant bots dynamically â€” tokens are stored securely in Vault, fetched on demand, and webhooks are set automatically.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Multi-tenant**: Each bot (tenant) has its own token and webhook endpoint.
- **Secure secret storage**: All tokens, DB DSNs, and other secrets are in Vault KV v2.
- **Webhook validation**: Incoming requests validated with `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token`.
- **Tenant cache**: Tokens are cached in memory for a configurable TTL.
- **Per-tenant isolation**: Each webhook request resolves its own bot instance.
- **Dynamic bot registration**: Add/remove tenants at runtime.
